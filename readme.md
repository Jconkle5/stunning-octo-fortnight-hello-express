- Here is an app that serves as a video game logger so that you can keep up with what games you have completed, are currently playing, abandoned, or have on standby for later. Everything saves in MongoDB, so it sticks around, and the front end talks to the back end through a REST API. Uses and shows off the full CRUD cycle.
