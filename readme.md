# CIS 486 Mini App Submission

- Will Cisco on [GitHub] (https://github.com/wcisco)
- [Demo App] (https://animated-octo-garbanzo-hello-express.onrender.com)
- [Will's Travel Wish List] (https://github.com/wcisco/animated-octo-garbanzo-hello-express)
- This app allows you to add places that you want to go. You can delete those places after you have gone or don't want to go anymore. You can also update them if you make a mistake. They will be stored in MongoDB. I will add the MONGOURI to the submission comments just incase of any issues.
